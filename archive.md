This section contains some non-peer-reviewed works from me.

Reciprocal Gamma Integrals:
---
Extensions of the Fransen-Robinson constant to the Hadamard and Luschny factorial functions. These are alternatives to the standard Euler Gamma $\Gamma(x)$ function. The Fransen-Robinson constant is given by $\int_{0}^{\infty} 1/\Gamma(x) \mathrm{d}x$.

Banach Saks Property:
---
A partial write up of the Banach-Saks property ,the property where the mean of weakly convergent sequences is strongly convergent. Should be understandable to someone with knowledge of Hilbert spaces. Includes a (well-known) proof of the property for Hilbert spaces.
